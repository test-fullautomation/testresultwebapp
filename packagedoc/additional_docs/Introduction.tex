TestResultWebApp is a web-based application which is developed and used at
\includegraphics[height=\fontcharht\font`\B]{./pictures/Bosch-Logo.png} since 2016 and was published
as open source on Github in 2020.

TestResultWebApp is used for visualizing and tracking test execution results. It
provides charts from an overview of the test result to the detail of all included
test cases.

It also provides tools to control the quality of developing software version
(under testing) by the a graphical comparison of test results from different
test executions.

TestResultWebApp is highly modular written. Therefore it is also easy to extend
it in order to add new graphics or evaluations of the test result data.

TestResultWebApp uses bootstrap, jquery, nodejs and mysql. For the charts is uses
chartjs and D3.
