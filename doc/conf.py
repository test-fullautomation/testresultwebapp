# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "./../")))
# print("(debug) sys.path:\n" + '\n'.join(sys.path))

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'TestResultWebApp'
copyright = '2022, Pollerspöck Thomas (XC-CT/ECA3)'
author = 'Pollerspöck Thomas (XC-CT/ECA3)'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',
    'sphinx.ext.viewcode',
    'sphinx.ext.todo',
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# -- Options for TEX/PDF output -------------------------------------------------

# Redefinition of text boxes (using LaTeX package 'tcolorbox' instead of the Sphinx internal 'sphinxlightbox' and 'sphinxheavybox')
latex_additional_files = ["latex_addons/sphinxlatexadmonitions.sty"]
# The original installation version of this file can be found here:
# <Python installation path>\Lib\site-packages\sphinx\texinputs\sphinxlatexadmonitions.sty
# The latex_addons folder contains this file with the same name!
# Reason: Because of too much dependencies and adaptions the complete file has to be exchanged!

latex_documents = [('index', 'TestResultWebApp.tex', project, author, 'manual', False)]

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.
#
# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.
language = 'en'

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ['_build', 'Thumbs.db', '.DS_Store']


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'alabaster'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
# html_static_path = ['_static'] # (currently not used)


# -- Extension configuration -------------------------------------------------

# -- Options for todo extension ----------------------------------------------

# If true, `todo` and `todoList` produce output, else they produce nothing.
