Package Documentation
---------------------

A detailed documentation of the TestResultWebApp package can be found here: `TestResultWebApp.pdf <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp/blob/develop/TestResultWebApp/TestResultWebApp.pdf>`_


Introduction
------------


TRWebApp is a generic web based open source application which allows processing displaying of test result data in a sophisticated way.

TRWebApp uses a mysql data base, nodejs on server side and JavaScript on Web-Browser side.


TRWebApp was initially implemented at |IMG_BOSCH| `Robert Bosch Car Multimedia <https://www.bosch.de/unser-unternehmen/bosch-in-deutschland/hildesheim/>`__ and was open sourced in 2020. 

Dashboard

   |IMG_WEBAPP_DASHBOARD|

Data table
   The data table allows you to
      - browse into the single test results. 
      - open the traceback for failed test cases.
      - collaborate with your team.
      - filter test cases.

Run-time view
   The run-time view shows you test cases grouped by compnent. The size of a block is relative for the run-time of a test case. This allows you to optimize the run-time of a your test suite.

Diff view
   The diff view allows you to diff test runs from different test suites.
   For this a spiral view is used where the center is the start of the test suite execution.
   
   The diff view allows you to
      - show only test cases which are other than passed.
      - show only test cases which are failed.
      - show only test cases which are new or missing.
      - open the traceback for failed test cases.
      - diff up to 5 versions
