## Getting Started

[TRWebApp](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp) is a
generic web based open source application which allows processing
displaying of test result data in a sophisticated way.

[TRWebApp](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp) uses
a mysql data base, nodejs on server side and JavaScript on Web-Browser
side.

[TRWebApp](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp) was
initially implemented at

[Robert Bosch Car

and was open sourced in 2020.

### How to install

## Usage

[TRWebApp](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp) has
the main menu (on the top) which allow you to:

-   select the branch, variant, version or component for
    views/comparison.
-   select the range of time for displaying test results in charts.
-   set the test result to appropriate state such as **released** or
    **died**.

[TRWebApp](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/testresultwebapp)
provides 4 main views which will give from the overview of the test
execution result to the detail of the single test results.

Besides, you can have the comparison to the previous test results or
related test results (different variants).

### Dashboard

The Dashboard shows an overview of the test execution result, such as:

-   Total test cases.
-   Passed rate.
-   Duration of test execution.
-   The execution time.
-   The test user
-   The test machine
-   \...

There are also some charts which help you to get the the overview
analysis about the test result, components\'s status or even the
comparison to the previous test execution results.

### Data table

The data table show all executed test case and their results order by
component\'s name. Besides, it also allows to:

-   browse into the detail of single test results.
-   open the traceback for failed test cases.
-   collaborate with your team by leaving your comment.
-   filter test cases.
-   search test cases.

### Run-time view

The run-time view shows you test cases grouped by compnent. The size of
a block is relative for the run-time of a test case. This allows you to
optimize the run-time of a your test suite.

### Diff view

The diff view allows you to diff test runs from different test suites.
For this a spiral view is used where the center is the start of the test
suite execution.

The diff view allows you to:

-   show only test cases which are other than passed.
-   show only test cases which are failed.
-   show only test cases which are new or missing.
-   open the traceback for failed test cases.
-   diff up to 5 versions.
