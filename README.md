## Introduction

TRWebApp is a generic web based open source application which allows
processing displaying of test result data in a sophisticated way.

TRWebApp uses a mysql data base, nodejs on server side and JavaScript on
Web-Browser side.

TRWebApp was initially implemented at

and was open sourced in 2020.

Data table

:   

    The data table allows you to

    :   -   browse into the single test results.
        -   open the traceback for failed test cases.
        -   collaborate with your team.
        -   filter test cases.

Run-time view

:   The run-time view shows you test cases grouped by compnent. The size
    of a block is relative for the run-time of a test case. This allows
    you to optimize the run-time of a your test suite.

Diff view

:   The diff view allows you to diff test runs from different test
    suites. For this a spiral view is used where the center is the start
    of the test suite execution.

    The diff view allows you to

    :   -   show only test cases which are other than passed.
        -   show only test cases which are failed.
        -   show only test cases which are new or missing.
        -   open the traceback for failed test cases.
        -   diff up to 5 versions
